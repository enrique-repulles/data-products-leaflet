## Description

In the city of Barcelona, the town hall publishes a web page with a lot of data sources about the city. The web page is: [http://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/]

I've selected a data source about traffic accidents. I show the accident location in the map, along with the date, number of deaths and injured.

The source of this document can be found at [https://github.com/enrique-repulles/data-products-leaflet]
